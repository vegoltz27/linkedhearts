### About Me

I love color and I adore texture. I'm fascinated by pattern, and I am addicted to fabric. I am a quilter! My happiest hours are spent working at my sewing machine, or standing in front of my long arm.  I learned to quilt nearly 30 years ago, and during those years I have made enough quilts to cover all my beds and walls, and to fill several closets with my art. I have taught many classes at local quilt shops, and have pieced quilts for customers. As the years progressed, it became apparent that piecing quilts was only half the picture.  I knew something was missing from my quilting life, and it was my APQS Mille which I added to my studio about 18 months ago.  I love using Quilt Path to stitch out edge to edge designs.  However, the true challenge of having Millie in my studio is learning the art of hand guided, free motion quilting.  Learning this new skill, and learning to draw, sketch, and doodle, was a little overwhelming at first.  I had some encouragement from my son (an accomplished artist himself) who told me, "Mom, all it takes is practice.  Anyone can learn to draw!"  Much to my surprise, he was absolutely correct!  Free motion quilting with Millie is incredibly fun, creative, and liberating.  I make it a point to try new techniques daily, and to practice, practice, practice until I come up with something I really love....feathers, pebbles, stitch in the ditch, ruler work, background fills for appliqu√©. It's all so much fun, and I embrace the challenge of designing layouts for quilt tops to enhance their beauty and character.

I also feel strongly about giving back to my community.  I support and donate to Project Linus, and I volunteer as a long arm quilter for the Quilts of Valor Foundation, turning out about 24 quilts per year for our country's veterans.

Thank you again for taking the time to visit my site.  Just remember, any day spent quilting is a great day!
