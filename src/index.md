Welcome to Linked Hearts Quilting!  Linked Hearts Quilting provides all over, edge to edge, and custom professional long arm quilting services at reasonable rates and fast turnaround times. We have many digitized patterns to choose from.  All our quilting is done on a Stitch Regulated APQS Millennium, and our computer guided patterns are sewn out with the assistance of Quilt Path.

We provide custom piecing in addition to our long arm quilting services.  T-Shirt quilts are our specialty!! So gather up all your old and treasured T-Shirts, and allow me to help you turn them into a quilt that will become a treasured family heirloom.
